"""
A fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer and no biases, trained to
predict y from x using Euclidean error.

This implementation uses numpy to manually compute the forward pass, loss, and
backward pass.

A numpy array is a generic n-dimensional array; it does not know anything about
deep learning or gradients or computational graphs, and is just a way to perform
generic numeric computations.
