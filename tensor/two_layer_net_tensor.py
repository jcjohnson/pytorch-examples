"""
A fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer and no biases, trained to
predict y from x by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation uses PyTorch tensors to manually compute the forward pass,
loss, and backward pass.

A PyTorch Tensor is basically the same as a numpy array: it does not know
anything about deep learning or computational graphs or gradients, and is just
a generic n-dimensional array to be used for arbitrary numeric computation.

The biggest difference between a numpy array and a PyTorch Tensor is that
a PyTorch Tensor can run on either CPU or GPU. To run operations on the GPU,
just cast the Tensor to a cuda datatype.
