"""
A fully-connected ReLU network with one hidden layer and no biases, trained to
predict y from x by minimizing squared Euclidean distance.

This implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch
Variables, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients.

A PyTorch Variable is a wrapper around a PyTorch Tensor, and represents a node
in a computational graph. If x is a Variable then x.data is a Tensor giving its
value, and x.grad is another Variable holding the gradient of x with respect to
some scalar value.

PyTorch Variables have the same API as PyTorch tensors: (almost) any operation
you can do on a Tensor you can also do on a Variable; the difference is that
autograd allows you to automatically compute gradients.
